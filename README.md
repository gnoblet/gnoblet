I'm a (humanitarian) quantitative researcher who loves a good meme almost as much as bouncing ideas around with others. Whether I'm trying to make sense of messy data or just swapping stories about bits of history, I genuinely enjoy taking complicated things and making them a little clearer—for others, and honestly, for myself too. And if we can share a laugh or two along the way, even better.

## ✨ Things I'm good at, enjoy, and feel somewhat passionate about

- **Research & Analysis**: statistical analysis, economic modeling, data structuration, data visualization, household surveys
- **Project Management**: horizontal project management, capacity building, co-training
- **Technical Toolbox**:  
  R (Tidyverse, Shiny, data.table, sf, tmap),  
  Python (Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, Plotnine),  
  QGIS, Kobo Toolbox
- **Interests**: data visualization, open source projects, community resilience, participatory approaches, socio-ecological analysis

## 🚀 My Latest Projects

- **TidyTuesday Contributions**  
  My weekly data visualization contributions to #TidyTuesday. Each visualization explores different datasets using R and Python, showcasing various visualization techniques and data analysis approaches. *(Ongoing)*

- **30 Day Chart Challenge**  
  My submissions for the #30DayChartChallenge, a community-driven data visualization event where participants create and share charts based on daily prompts. First participation in 2025.

- **hespeR: Humanitarian Emergency Settings Perceived Needs Scale**  
  *(Ongoing)* R package for handling the WHO's HESPER. In collaboration with Raphael Bacot, it aims to provide an integrated data workflow (wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization) based on the HESPER survey methodology.

- **visualizeR: Utility functions for Humanitarian Viz**  
  *(Ongoing)* R package providing utility functions and sane defaults for humanitarian analysts with colors, scales and default visualizations.
